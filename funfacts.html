          <div class="text">When she was only 7 years old, Grace took apart her alarm clock to see how it worked. But she did not know how to put it back together, so she found another clock to try. But again, as soon as she opened the back, everything fell out. Grace opened five more alarm clocks. When Grace's parents discovered the clocks, they did not scold her. In fact, her mother let her have one alarm clock just so she could experiment on it.

          <div class="text">In most sources (even the Smithsonian!), Grace is credited as using the term "debug" for the first time in a journal entry about finding a moth in the Mark I. However, research shows that she was not actually the one to first use this term.
